# How To Use
Windows:

Linux:
On Linux you will need to navigate to the start.sh file in Chemplusplus/Code/, this will run the python program that will start the GUI 

# Dependencies
You will need to have the following installed in order to run Chem++
1. [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/)

# Documentation
Here Is The Offical Documentation For Chem++
## Info

When you call the info command in the application it will return the following information about the element

1. AtomicNumber
2. Symbol
3. Name
4. AtomicMass
5. CPKHexColor
6. ElectronConfiguration
7. Electronegativity
8. AtomicRadius
9. IonizationEnergy
10. ElectronAffinity
11. OxidationStates
12. StandardState
13. MeltingPoint
14. BoilingPoint
15. Density
16. GroupBlock
17. YearDiscovered

At the time of writing this documentation there is no margin for error when it comes to spelling the name of the lement correctly. It must be spelled correctly with the first letter being capitalized.

## Bohr Diagram

When you call for a bohr diagram from the application it will create a new window with the diagram along with the following information

1. The charge
2. The number of electrons

At the time of writing this documentation there is no margin for error when it comes to spelling the name of the lement correctly. It must be spelled correctly with the first letter being capitalized.

## Unit Conversion

When you call the unit conversion button a new window will pop up. The element you put into the original box will be used for calculations as each elemnts has a different grams to mole ratio. At the time of writing this only one input field can have information i.e. 5 mols of Helium or 10g of Hydrogen. There is a clear button in the bottom right which automaticall clears the boxes for ease of access. There is also an enter button. When this is pressed it will automatically fill the remaining boxes with thir according values.

## Search Bar

The search bar eliminates the need for the user to open a browser. Whatever is entered into the input will be sent to the chemistry stack exchange. It will take the top 3 results and display them in a new window. There are forward and backward buttons which can be pressed in the top left of this new window, these allow you to shift between the answers. At the time of writing this there are still problems with the formatting of the questions.
