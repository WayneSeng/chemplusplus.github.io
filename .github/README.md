Here is the Official Documentation for Chem++

## Info

When you call the info command in the application it will return the following information about the element:

1. `AtomicNumber`
2. `Symbol`
3. `Name`
4. `AtomicMass`
5. `CPKHexColor`
6. `ElectronConfiguration`
7. `Electronegativity`
8. `AtomicRadius`
9. `IonizationEnergy`
10. `ElectronAffinity`
11. `OxidationStates`
12. `StandardState`
13. `MeltingPoint`
14. `BoilingPoint`
15. `Density`
16. `GroupBlock`
17. `YearDiscovered`

## Bohr Diagram
![Bohr Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemplusplus/chemplusplus.github.io/main/Screenshots/bohr_diagram_page.png)

When you call for a bohr diagram from the application, it will create a new window with the diagram, along with the charge, and the number of electrons.

## Unit Conversion
![Unit Conversion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemplusplus/chemplusplus.github.io/main/Screenshots/unit_page.png)

When you click the unit conversion button a new window will pop up. The element you put into the original box will be used for calculations as each element has a different grams to mole ratio. At the time of writing this only one input field can have information i.e. `5 mols` of Helium or `10g` of Hydrogen. There is a clear button, and an enter button, in the bottom right which automatically clears the boxes for ease of access.  When the enter button is pressed it will automatically fill the remaining boxes with their according values.

## Search Bar
The search bar eliminates the need for the user to open a browser. Whatever is entered into the input will be sent to the [Chemistry Stack Exchange](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/), it will take the top 3 results and display them in a new window. There are forward and backward buttons which can be pressed in the top left of this new window, these allow you to shift between the answers. We are working on formatting the results.

## Equation Balancer
![Equation Balancer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemplusplus/chemplusplus.github.io/main/Screenshots/balence.png)

The equation balancer eliminates the need to do complex calculations. By simply entering your unbalanced equation and clicking on get balance, your balanced equation will be returned to you in milliseconds!

## Compound Diagram
![Compound Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemplusplus/chemplusplus.github.io/main/Screenshots/compound_diagram_page.png)

No need to open an browser! After entering a compound name, clicking on `get struct`, your entry will be searched on the pubchem database. In a few seconds, your compound diagram will be returned back to you.

## Significant Figures
![Significant Figures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemplusplus/chemplusplus.github.io/main/Screenshots/sigfig.png)

Ever wondering how to write a number in 4 `sf`? No need to worry anymore! By simply entering your number into the `Insert Number` field, the `sf` into the `Places` field, and clicking on get result, the answer will instantly appear in the `Insert Number` field.

## Scientific Notation
![Scientific Notation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemplusplus/chemplusplus.github.io/main/Screenshots/notation.png)

Scientific Notation is sometimes hard to understand. By simply entering a number and clicking on `get sci notation`, you will instantly know how to write a number in Scientific Notation.
