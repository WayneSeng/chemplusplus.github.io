# Contact Form
This was my first ever attempt to make a contact form with **HTML5**, and **PHP**. This does not include any stylesheet, although I am planning on adding a **CSS3**, **SCSS**, or **Less** stylesheet sometime in the future.
## About
After spending sometime making a website for [Chem++](https://chemplusplus.github.io) I was experiencing some trouble with making a contact form. I had learned **HTML**, and **CSS**, and was reasonably good with **JavaScript**. So I decided to try out some **PHP**. Following many internet guides I created this Form. I am slowly going to work on it and add my new attempts to this repository so you can see the progress. And maybe I might even incorporate this into the website for [Chem++](https://chemplusplus.github.io).
## Future Plans
Although this project is for fun. Here are some things I have planned for it:
 - [ ] Add **CSS** to make the form look better.
 - [ ] Make the form store emails in some kind of database.
 - [ ] Find a way to pair collected data with **Google Analytics**.
 - [ ] Apply this contact form to the website for [Chem++](https://chemplusplus.github.io).
